# audio

A python library for audio synthesis and effects

**Note:** To be able to play sounds, you need to have the `aplay` command-line
player, which is availible for Linux systems (and should already be installed
on most of them). If `aplay` isn't availible for you, you'll have to export the
sounds and play them using your audio player of choice.

To install it, get the `audio_janq0` package with the following command

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/janq0/audio.git
```

Next, you can read the [documentation](https://janq0.github.io/audio/audio_janq0.html)
and see the directory `examples`.
